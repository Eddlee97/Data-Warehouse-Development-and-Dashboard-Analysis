# Data Warehouse Development and Business Intelligence Dashboard Analysis

### Project Idea & Goal:

Identify how Airbnb revenue factors generated by Citibike traffic/usage. Does more Citibike stations in New York City make an Airbnb rental more attractive and lucrative to their customers, and how can Airbnb generate more revenue based on Citibike traffic/usage? Which areas in New York City contains the most Citibike traffic/usage, and how can they contribute values to Airbnb in post-pandemic season?

The goal is this project is to analyze these questions will help Airbnb have a better understanding on which areas should they promote more/less to overcome its post-pandemic financial stress and how can they generate more revenues efficiently.
  
### Project Idea & Goal:

According to Airbnb earnings in Q4. The company posted an enormous loss in the fourth quarter of 2020 as it suffered from the pandemic downturn and revenue has dropped 30% in 2020 compared to previous year. To effectively solve this issue, we want to understand the correlation between Airbnb listings revenue and the Citibike traffic/usage in New York City. The opportunity may arise based on our findings in this project which will allow Airbnb to potentially understand lucrative rental locations and hot zones that may bring profits to the company.

- **Total Revenue per Location based on Citibike Traffic** <br>

   - Scatter plot was used with two y-axis to easily describe the relationship between the total revenue per location and the number of Citibike trips <br>
   - Filtered the top 15 locations in terms of Citibike traffic <br>
   - Left y-axis: number of citibikes trips | Right y-axis: total revenue <br>
